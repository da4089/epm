- 1.0.0 - "xxx"
  - added Remove button which removes a user's entry that should not
    be displayed any longer.  This doesn't remove that user from your
    subscriptions, but is handy for when people change their name,
    etc.
  - added Refresh button which requests a status update from all
    buddies.
  - expanded status information, including ability to set
    unavailable/offline statuses
  - display of unavailable?/unavailable/offline status for received
    presence
  - support for external activity monitoring, as provided by xipd

- 0.3 - "bsd"
  - new licence: epm/epmd is now available under the terms of the BSD
    open source licence.
  - support for protocol draft v0.4 (see the doc directory).
  - epmd now uses Proxy-Agent header to distinguish its responses from
    genuine client responses.
  - epmd does not (yet) respond to Presence-Requests via the Groups
    values: it only deals with Users.  this needs to be done soonish.
  - epmd now ignores Presence-Info notifications that are older than
    its most-recent cached value.
