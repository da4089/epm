- 0.3 - "bsd"
  - new licence: epm/epmd is now available under the terms of the BSD
    open source licence.
  - support for protocol draft v0.4 (see the doc directory).
  - epmd now uses Proxy-Agent header to distinguish its responses from
    genuine client responses.
  - epmd does not (yet) respond to Presence-Requests via the Groups
    values: it only deals with Users.  this needs to be done soonish.
  - epmd now ignores Presence-Info notifications that are older than
    its most-recent cached value.
