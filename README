epm README
----------

copy the "epm.conf" file to your home directory, renaming it to
".epm".  ensure it is not writable by anyone except yourself
(ie. chmod 600 ~/.epm). edit to taste.  be careful with the syntax --
it's Python ;-)

run the epm script.

command-line args are the same as xtickertape.
